# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
A machine learning model to classify tweets as positive or negative using Python, Scikit-learn, and NLTK.

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis üê¶

This project is a machine learning model that classifies tweets as positive or negative. It uses a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset of 1.6 million tweets.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Uses NLTK for text stemming and stopword removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical data using `TfidfVectorizer`.
- **Model**: A Logistic Regression model trained with Scikit-learn.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 77.7% on the test data.

## Dataset
This project uses the "Sentiment140" dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The data is not included in this repository due to its size. You can download it from Kaggle: [Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

## How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JayKumarPal0108/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/JayKumarPal0108/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git)
    cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
    ```
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Download the NLTK stopwords:**
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```
4.  **Download the dataset** from the link above and place `training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv` in the project directory.

5.  Open and run the `Sentiment_Anlaysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- re

## Model Performance and Insights

The model was trained on 80% of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining 20%.

- **Test Accuracy:** **`77.7%`**
- **Training Accuracy:** **`79.9%`**

The close alignment between the training and test scores indicates that the model generalizes well without significant overfitting.

### Technical Details

- **Dataset:** The model was trained on the **Sentiment140** dataset, which is perfectly balanced with **1.6 million tweets** (800,000 positive and 800,000 negative).
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Each tweet was processed by:
    1.  Removing mentions, links, and all non-alphabetic characters.
    2.  Converting the text to lowercase.
    3.  Filtering out common English stopwords using NLTK.
    4.  Applying the **Porter Stemmer** to reduce words to their root form.
- **Feature Engineering:** The cleaned text was transformed into numerical data using `TfidfVectorizer`, resulting in a vocabulary of over **460,000 unique features (word stems)**.
- **Classifier:** A **Logistic Regression** model from Scikit-learn was used for the final sentiment classification.
